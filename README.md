# Arduino MP3 Player with Graphical Interface

This project implements an MP3 player using Arduino and a DFPlayer Mini module, controlled through a graphical interface created in Processing. The Arduino sketch establishes communication between the Arduino board and the DFPlayer Mini for playing MP3 files. The graphical interface, developed in Processing, allows users to control playback functions such as play/pause, next, and previous.

## Hardware Requirements

- Arduino board (compatible with the DFPlayer Mini)
- DFPlayer Mini MP3 module
- SD card with MP3 files

## Software Requirements

- Arduino IDE
- Processing IDE

## Features

- Play/Pause toggle functionality
- Next and Previous track navigation
- Volume control (initial volume set to 10)

## Getting Started

1. Connect the DFPlayer Mini to the Arduino board.
2. Ensure the SD card is inserted with the desired MP3 files.
3. Upload the provided Arduino sketch to the Arduino board.
4. Run the Processing sketch to launch the graphical interface.
